Morbidity of asthma has increased over the world. The reasons for this increase have
remained unclear. Studies in children have reported considerable East-West difference
in the prevalence of atopy and respiratory allergies.
   The aim of this thesis was to compare the prevalence and risk factors of respiratory
symptoms, atopic sensitisation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in young
adults in Estonia and Sweden. 
   Following the protocol of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey
(ECRHS), two random population samples, 3000 from Tartu, Estonia, and 3600 from
Uppsala, Sweden were investigated with postal questionnaires. Random sub samples
and subjects with asthma-like complaints were subsequently interviewed, BHR was
tested and serum samples analysed for total and specific IgE and eosinophil cationic
protein (ECP). In a separate study two methacholine challenge methods, using either
Spira Elektro2 or Mefar MB3 as dosimeters, were compared on 28 mild to moderate
asthma patients.
   Symptoms of asthma and hay fever were less common in Estonia than in Sweden,
while respiratory symptoms in general were more common in Estonia. The prevalence
of BHR was high and the prevalence of atopy and the levels of serum ECP were low in
Tartu. The differences between the two centres in the prevalence of atopy and allergic
rhinitis diminished with age, indicating a probable cohort effect. Current smoking was a
dominant risk factor BHR and for all respiratory symptoms, except attacks of asthma,
both in Tartu and Uppsala. There was some difference between risk factors for BHR
and atopy between Tartu and Uppsala, mostly of social and environmental origin. The
low prevalence of hay fever and asthma in Tartu seemed to be partly explained by a
lack of awareness of  atopy and allergic diseases in the Estonian society. The estimated
cumulative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 was smaller and the decline of FEV1
/log(dose) curve steeper, using the Spira, compared to Mefar protocol. 
Key words: asthma, atopic sensitisation, prevalence, epidemiology, ECRHS.

INTRODUCTION
Asthma has been recognised by clinicians for more than two millenniums. Probably not much
has changed from that time in the clinical picture of the disease, as the first descriptions of
asthma resemble to that what doctors would also nowadays consider classical asthma. The first
epidemiological studies of asthma date back to the first half of the XXth century. Since then a
global increase in asthma prevalence has been revealed. While the reasons for this increase re-
main unclear, there can be no doubt that asthma is now a major health problem worldwide.
Clustered in families, asthma has a genetic predisposition. It is unlikely, however, that the ge-
netic makeup of stable populations can change significantly within one century, so the probable
cause of the asthma epidemic must lie in the environment.
Asthma epidemiological studies are currently in the phase of that of cancer and coronary heart
disease at the mid of the XXth century when international comparisons of the prevalence and
incidence of those diseases revealed the major risk factors and formed the bases of the further
research. The major obstacles in asthma epidemiology are the lack of a definition of asthma, the
transient nature of the principal symptom, and the absence of simple, sensitive, and specific
markers for the condition.
2
BACKGROUND
Definition of asthma
Many pulmonary diseases can be defined by their causative agent e.g., tuberculosis, or by de-
fined pathology e.g., squamous cell carcinoma, or by characteristic clinical presentation. For
asthma, the primary cause remains unknown, pathology is rarely available at the time of diag-
nosis and the clinical presentation can be variable. Hence, to date, no universally acceptable
definition has been formulated 1. The term “asthma” encompasses a disparate group of disor-
ders which produce similar clinical effects – that is, variable airflow obstruction - and this has
formed the basis of the definition of asthma. Perhaps the most concise and useful description of
asthma is: a clinical syndrome of  “variable airflow obstruction.”
Development of understanding the mechanisms of asthma, and desire to give a definition that
would satisfy clinicians, physiologist, genetics, immunologists, molecular biologists, pharma-
cologists, epidemiologists as well as pathologists have added new components to the definition.
Current consensus definition of asthma has captured the history of development of understand-
ing of the mechanisms of asthma in last decades and states:
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, in which many cells play a role, in
particular mast cells, eosinophils, and T-lymphocytes. In susceptible individuals, this inflam-
mation causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, chest tightness, and cough, particularly at night
and/or in the early morning. Theses symptoms are usually associated with widespread but vari-
able airflow limitation that is at least partially reversible either spontaneously or with treat-
ment. The inflammation also causes an associated increase in airway responsiveness to a vari-
ety of stimuli 2.
This descriptive definition of asthma, however, can not be translated into practical terms for
epidemiological studies. Furthermore, despite the definition accepted for asthma, a diagnosis of
asthma in clinical practice is made on the basis of combined information from history, physical
examination, and respiratory function tests, often over a period of time. Time-consuming clini-
cal testing is of little value in epidemiological setting because of low response rates and possi-
ble noncomparability of methods across countries and regions. For these reasons, comparisons
of asthma prevalence are increasingly being based on a simple comparison of symptom preva-
lence in a questionnaire survey of a large number of people, followed by more intensive testing
3
of the underlying immunological and physiological components that often characterise clinical
asthma, like bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and atopy, in a sub sample. 
Outcome variables in asthma epidemiology
Variable obstruction
Methods used in clinical diagnosing of asthma are difficult to apply in epidemiological settings,
especially in cross sectional studies. The main reason for that is the variable nature of asthma.
Verification of reversible airway obstruction, which is considered critical in establishing a clear
clinical diagnosing of asthma 2,3, would therefore underestimate the true prevalence, as reversi-
ble airway obstruction might not be revealed at time of testing.
Self reported asthma
Questionnaire based self reported asthma is often used in epidemiological studies. It has usually
high specificity but low sensitivity to the actual disease, as all the cases of asthma are never di-
agnosed in the population 4. This leads to an underestimation of the true prevalence of asthma.
Further problems arise, when different populations with differences in labelling of asthma and
diagnostic practice are compared, as the differences in diagnostic practice may be as great in
magnitude as the real differences in asthma morbidity. A definition of high specificity is how-
ever important, when risk factors are estimated 5. 
Symptoms of asthma
A number of symptoms, including wheezing, chest tightness, breathlessness, and coughing with
or without sputum, are recognized by physicians as indicative of asthma. Symptom recording,
based on standard postal and interview questionnaires, have also widely been used in epidemi-
ological studies and can overcome some of the problems with diagnostic labelling. Symptom
recording has, however, its own potential problems, arising from subjective symptoms recogni-
tion and recall, depending on variety of psychological, social and cultural characteristics, in-
cluding healthcare practices, and also on the translation of the questionnaire. Those problems
are evidently enhanced, when populations with different background regarding those factors are
compared. To give an example, the term “wheeze” that has been used most often in epidemiol-
ogical studies for the identification of asthma, can not be easily translated into many languages,
furthermore, the specificity of the symptom to asthma may differ in populations with different
prevalence of other conditions that can cause wheeze, like chronic bronchitis or COPD. High
international consistency has, however, been shown in answers to different questions in multi-
4
lingual studies, indicating that international comparisons are not affected by errors due to cross-
cultural variations in the reporting of symptoms 6.
To overcome cultural and language differences, video questionnaires have been introduced to
asthma epidemiology studies. So far they have been used in children, and have shown good re-
peatability and slightly lower accuracy in detecting asthma 7, but general good correlation with
the results of the written questionnaires 8.
Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR)
The main objective using BHR in asthma epidemiology studies is, to avoid problems of subjec-
tive symptom recall that may occur with symptom questionnaires. The results of BHR testing
clearly depend on which agent or stimulus has been used for provocation 9. The best standard-
ised methods are today available for direct stimuli, like histamine and methacholine that cause
air-flow limitation by a direct action on the effector cells involved in the air-glow limitation,
such as airway smooth-muscle cells, bronchial vascular endothelial cells and mucus-producing
cells 10. Comparisons between different delivery systems 11-13 and agents used 14 have shown
good correlation, so different methods using either histamine or methacholine, have been con-
sidered roughly equivalent 9. As choosing a threshold is always arbitrary in defining if the sub-
ject is bronchially hyperreactive or not, and to overcome the data loss in dichotomous analyses
of the data, slope measures have been introduced that allow to get data for analyses from all
participants in the study 11. Agents that act as specific constrictors in asthma through indirect
stimuli via cellular activation or neural stimuli, such as inhaled adenosine monophosphate
(AMP) are more closely associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma, but have
so far been used sparsely in community studies 15,16.
BHR testing was introduced to the asthma epidemiology studies at the beginning of the 1980s,
based on early studies, where high sensitivity of BHR for diagnosed asthma was shown on se-
lected groups of  patients compared to healthy controls 17,18. Subsequent, population based vali-
dations, comparing both symptom questionnaires and BHR, with asthma defined on the basis of
a clinical assessment by a physician, however, did not confirm those results 4,19,20. Thus, while
the sensitivity of questionnaires for physician diagnosis of asthma was 80% in adults and 61%
in children, and the specificity 97% and 94%, respectively, the sensitivity of BHR for physician
diagnosed asthma was only 39% for adults and 54% for children 19. The problems of the valid-
ity of BHR testing in asthma prevalence studies can not be overcome by combining BHR with
symptoms in defining asthma, which has also been suggested 3,18. A definition of asthma re-
5
quiring both a positive questionnaire response and BHR was highly specific but not sensitive
for adults (37%) or children (47%) 19.
The subject of validity of BHR testing in asthma prevalent studies has recently been summa-
rised by Pearce et al. 21, concluding that current evidence suggests that BHR testing has no
greater validity (and may even have lesser) than symptom questionnaires for measuring the dif-
ference in asthma prevalence between populations with the same language and similar symptom
recognition and reporting, but it may provide more comparable information when comparing
populations which do not share these characteristics. BHR testing in epidemiological studies
can, besides potentially lowering the response rate, introduce selection bias, as severe obstruc-
tion is usually considered a contraindication for provocation test and the most severe cases will
therefore not be tested.
Thus, BHR testing can not provide validation of the existence of differences in the prevalence
of asthma between populations but can, however, be useful in terms of interpreting the findings
of symptom prevalence questionnaire, showing to what extent the differences can be explained
by BHR.
Other outcome variables
Although asthma and atopy are strongly associated, they also occur independently of each
other 22. Thus, in asthma epidemiology studies, atopy is not a surrogate measure for asthma. It
is both an associated condition (which is of interest in itself), and a risk factor for developing
asthma. In the latter context, atopy can also be considered as an intermediate step in the causal
pathways leading from allergen exposure to asthma – i.e., it may be an intermediate factor and a
modifier of the effects of other exposures 23. Atopy is also strongly associated with BHR, but
the two conditions often occur independently of each other. 
The number of eosinophil granulocytes in peripheral blood (B-Eos) is traditionally the most
common method in assessing inflammation in epidemiological research 24-28. More recently,
measurements of eosinophil degranulation products, such as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)
in peripheral blood has been introduced as a method to assess and monitor inflammation in
asthmatic patients 29-31. There is, however, limited experience in using these kinds of  inflam-
matory markers in asthma epidemiological research 32,33.
6
Increase in prevalence
Data from epidemiological studies conducted in several countries worldwide have revealed that
the prevalence of allergic conditions, including allergic rhinitis, asthma and eczema, have in-
creased from the 1940s/50s to the 1990s 34-37. Although the increase of asthma prevalence may,
in part, be explained by altered diagnostic criteria and increased awareness of the disease, both
in the general population and among physicians, these studies together indicate that the in-
creased prevalence of asthma during the last decades is real. Trends of increasing prevalence of
asthma have also been shown in Nordic countries 38,39. Data on asthma prevalence in Estonia
are limited to studies conducted in the 1990s and it might be too early to look for changes in
prevalence.
Regional differences in prevalence
International and regional asthma prevalence comparisons are required as a key step in ascer-
taining the causes of asthma 40. The key issue in prevalence comparisons is, that the information
is obtained in a comparable manner across all participating centres and countries, and that
problems of translation of questionnaires and other problems of noncomparability of informa-
tion are minimised. Two large scale epidemiological studies that allow comparison across sev-
eral countries fulfil these criteria: The European Community Health Survey (ECRHS) 41,42
among adults and the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC) 43 in
children.
The database of the ECRHS includes information from approximately 140,000 individuals from
22 countries. Based on analyses of the whole ECRHS data set, geographical variations in dif-
ferent outcome variables, i.e. diagnosed asthma, respiratory symptoms, atopic sensitisation and
bronchial responsiveness have been described 44-47. An eight-fold variation in the prevalence of
wheeze, a four-fold variation in the prevalence of nasal allergy 44 and a six-fold variation in the
prevalence of current asthma 44,47 was found. The prevalence of all symptoms varied widely.
Although these were generally lower in northern, central and southern Europe and higher in the
British Isles, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, there were wide variations even
within some countries 48. Analyses of bronchial responsiveness showed an eight-fold variation
in BHR (PD20 < 1 mg). The geographical distribution of bronchial responsiveness (ECRHS
slope) and BHR fitted well with that for symptoms and asthma 45. A wide geographical varia-
tion was also found when investigating the prevalence of atopic sensitisation (specific IgE) 46.
A high prevalence was found in Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States,
while the prevalence was low in Iceland, Greece, Norway, Italy and parts of Spain. A five-fold
7
variation was found in the geometric mean of total IgE but there was no correlation between
total IgE and atopic sensitisation 46. 
The ISAAC design comprises three phases. Phase One used simple core written questionnaires
for two age groups, and was completed in 156 collaborating centres in 56 countries and a total
of 721.601 children participated. In the 13-14 years age group 155 centres from 56 countries
participated, of which 99 centres also completed a video questionnaire. For the 6-7 years age
group there were 91 collaborating centres in 38 countries. The study has demonstrated a large
variation in the prevalence of asthma symptoms in children throughout the world. The preva-
lence of wheeze in the last 12 months ranged from 2-32% in the older age group and from 4-
32% in the younger age group and was particularly high in English speaking countries and
Latin America. A video questionnaire, completed in the older age group in 99 centres (42
countries), showed a similar pattern 8,49. The prevalence of atopy-related disorders was higher
in Scandinavia than in Estonia, Latvia and Poland, which in turn had a higher prevalence than
five other countries of eastern Europe with a culture less similar to western Europe 50. The
prevalence data from the ISAAC study were compared to the data from the ECRHS 51. The
prevalence estimates in the ECRHS were consistently lower than the prevalence rates in the 13-
14 years age group in the ISAAC study. There was, however, generally a good correlation be-
tween the prevalence of wheeze and asthma in the ECRHS and the corresponding prevalence in
the ISAAC study.
Within country comparisons of urban and rural populations have shown lower prevalence of
asthma in the latter, both in western 52 and in developing countries 53. In some cases the differ-
ences have been striking 54. Furthermore, comparing the lifetime prevalence of physician diag-
nosed asthma in Finnish first-year university students aged 18-24 according to childhood resi-
dence, revealed a significantly lower prevalence in those students who grew up in farm envi-
ronments compared to those who grew up in urban or rural areas but not in a farm. No differ-
ence in asthma prevalence was found when students from urban and from rural non-farm envi-
ronment were compared 55. 
Prevalence studies have revealed three distinctive patterns: first, asthma is more prevalent in
English-speaking countries; second, asthma is more common in Western countries than in de-
veloping countries and the difference is larger in later birth cohorts; third, the prevalence of
asthma is lower in rural than in urban regions, especially among those, who have grown up in
8
farm environment. These results also indicate that the current recognised risk factors for the de-
velopment of asthma probably cannot fully account neither for the worldwide increase in
prevalence nor for the international variations in asthma prevalence. For example, the global
pattern of asthma prevalence is consistent with the considerable body of evidence that air pol-
lution is not a major risk factor for the development of asthma. Regions such as China and
Eastern Europe, where some of the highest levels of traditional air pollution such as particulate
matter and SO2 are found, generally have lower asthma prevalence than the countries of West-
ern Europe and North America, Australia, and New Zealand, which have lower levels of pollu-
tion.
East-West difference in asthma prevalence
Western lifestyle has been accused for the increase in the prevalence of asthma and allergies.
Prosperity in West European countries with market economy might have changed the environ-
ment to the extent, where the spread of possible disease modifiers have reached to the extent
where it is not possible to evaluate their impact without comparing them with reference popula-
tions. Comparisons of populations that are culturally and geographically similar but differ on
the level of “westernisation” could give better possibility to extract risk factors from the
“westernisation” than comparing populations that differ in many other aspects. The end of the
Soviet era in Eastern Europe has given a unique possibility to evaluate the health effects of
“westernisation”.
The firs east-west comparison was carried out shortly after the reunification of Germany among
10-year old schoolchildren living in Leipzig, former East, and Munich, former West Ger-
many 56. The study found lower prevalence of hay fever in the eastern part of Germany. The
prevalence of asthma, defined as either doctor diagnosed asthma ever or recurrent wheezy
bronchitis did not differ significantly between the two populations, while the doctor diagnosed
chronic bronchitis was about twice as high in Leipzig. The prevalence of wheeze was similar
and there was no difference in the prevalence of BHR measured by cold air challenge. 
In a subsequent study, the same population in Munich was compared to a bigger random sample
from Leipzig and Dresden. Atopic sensitisation was estimated by skin prick testing, current
asthma, and life long incidence of asthma was reported, and definition of BHR was slightly
changed. In this study the prevalence of asthma, hay fever, atopic sensitisation and BHR was
lower in Leipzig and Dresden, while the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and chronic bron-
chitis was higher in Leipzig and Dresden than in Munich 57.
9
Other prevalence comparisons in the beginning of the 1990s between previously socialist coun-
tries in Eastern Europe and industrialised countries with market economy in Western Europe,
have constantly shown lower prevalence of atopic sensitisation and hay fever, both among chil-
dren 52,57-61 and adults 62,63. The difference in sensitisation between the centres has been found
to decrease with increasing age 63,64, indicating a cohort effect, i.e. the causative environmental
factors would be operating mainly in early childhood. There is at least one presented exception,
where no east-west difference in the prevalence of atopic sensitisation was revealed in the study
conducted in the year 1991. In this study five- to seven-year-old children from Eastern and
Western Germany were tested by a multipuncture device 60. The groups were, however, rela-
tively small (Eastern Germany was represented only by 287 subjects) and there were big differ-
ences in the prevalence of atopy between centres from the western part of Germany.
The rate for diagnosed asthma has also tended to be higher in western than in eastern popula-
tions 48,57,61,62,65, whereas less information is available on BHR and the results have been con-
tradictory. Thus, the comparisons of eastern and western Germany have shown a higher preva-
lence of BHR in the West, both among children, measured either by cold air challenge 57 or hy-
pertonic saline 65 and among adults, measured by methacholine challenge 62. The prevalence of
BHR, as measured by methacholine challenge, was however high among Estonian children 66.  
The reasons for the East-West differences in atopy and related respiratory diseases has re-
mained mostly unexplained. In most cases neither personal nor environmental risk factors could
provide satisfactory explanations for the area differences in symptoms, BHR 62 or atopic sensi-
tisation 57,63, as the differences in prevalence have remained statistically significant after al-
lowing for confounding factors. In some reports the observed prevalence differences in atopy
and respiratory allergies have partly been related to factors like “wood or coal heating” 61,62 or
“reported family history of atopy” 61, that can also serve as surrogate measures for some envi-
ronmental factors not measured. The published data do not support the view that the differences
in sensitisation are caused by differences in the exposure to specific allergens 67. The east-west
difference in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and chronic bronchitis has been explained
by higher prevalence of smoking and ambient air pollution with particulate matter and SO2 56,68. 
 
Recent studies have shown some converging in the described differences. Thus, the prevalence
of atopic sensitisation and hay fever had increased in Leipzig after four years of unification 69 
10
and no difference in the prevalence of atopic sensitisation and hay fever among 9-11 year old
children could be revealed between Leipzig and Munich 65. Similar trends have shown among
adults. By the ECRHS study group in Germany a second stage 1 questionnaire was sent out to a
new random population sample 3-4 years after the previous one. The result of this study showed
that the prevalence rates of wheezing, asthma attacks, asthma medication and allergic rhinitis
were stable in Hamburg but increasing in Erfurt and approaching those of Hamburg 70. In a sub-
sequent follow up of the German stage 2 sample the prevalence of BHR was found to have in-
creased in subjects living in Erfurt, while BHR remained unchanged in the group of subjects
from Hamburg 71. In Estonia two cross-sectional studies, the first in 1992-1993 58 and the sec-
ond in 1996-1997 72, among 10-year-old children did not show significant increase in 12-
month prevalence of wheeze, self reported asthma or atopic sensitisation. 
Factors that influence asthma
The prime consideration in asthma epidemiology studies is usually to obtain exposure informa-
tion of similar accuracy for the groups being compared. Strictly speaking, “exposure” refers to
the presence of a substance in the environment, whereas “dose” refers to the amount of sub-
stance that reaches susceptibility targets within the body. As personal dose measurements can
often not be obtained, the term exposure has been used in the very general sense, including
other attributes or agents that may be risk factors for asthma, like demographic and genetic
factors 23. Due to inherent variable nature of asthma, it is also usually not possible to distin-
guish, especially in cross sectional studies, if the factor studied is attributable to development of
or exacerbation of asthma. However, major problems of morbidity, occurring through exacer-
bation and prolongation of asthma symptoms, can best be addressed by studying prevalence
rather than incidence. Thus, if factors are found to be associated with asthma prevalence, then
this is of major interest in itself, irrespective of whether the etiologic mechanism involves in-
crease in asthma incidence or increase in duration.
Age and Sex
The prevalence of wheeze and reported asthma is negatively related to age among adults 73-76.
BHR declines with age in atopic non-smokers and increases with age in smokers 77,78. Further-
more, many cases of adult-onset asthma can actually be the return of asthma symptoms in sub-
jects who had asthma in childhood.
In childhood males have a higher incidence of asthma than females, but in adolescence this re-
verses and between the ages 10-50 years females have a higher incidence than males. In later
11
life the incidence possibly reverses once more 79. This has also been reflected in prevalence
studies 80-82. In males, higher BHR has been observed in childhood-adolescence age groups and
at older ages, while in females a higher level of BHR has been observed during adulthood 83,84.
Those differences can be partly attributable to sex differences in lung growth and airway ge-
ometry 82,85, but may also be connected to the sex-related differences in the immune system.
Facilitation of ovule implantation and tolerance to the foetus (a semi allograft) are required for
a successful pregnancy. A decrease in the rejection of potential allogens is particularly marked
during pregnancy, but also occurs in general in women, during the childbearing age, and more
particularly during the periovular phase of the menstrual cycle 78,86. A positive correlation has
been found in asthma incidence and hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal
women 87. Also, premenstrual worsening of asthma symptoms with increase in airway resis-
tance has been reported 88,89.
Gender differences in the effects of environmental factors may be related to personal habits,
like tobacco and alcohol consumption, the occupational environment, and the home environ-
ment. Women have been found to be more susceptible than men to environmental factors 90-93.
As it is, in general, socially acceptable for women to be breathless of effort and for men to bring
up phlegm and snore, this can introduce recall bias and challenge the interpretation of results 86.
Genetic factors
Asthma appears to be multifactorial in origin and influenced by multiple genes and environ-
mental factors. A particular genetic factor may increase susceptibility to the effects of an envi-
ronmental exposure and may thereby affect one or more aspects of the complex etiological pro-
cess involved in asthma, but whether this genetic potential is expressed will depend on whether
sufficient exposure to the environmental factor occurs. Asthma genetic studies are further com-
plicated by the difficulties in defining the asthma “phenotype” and by the fact that this pheno-
typic expression may vary with age. Despite the fact that genetic susceptibility to changing en-
vironmental exposures may play an important role in the changes in asthma prevalence, the
considerable increase in asthma prevalence during the last decades indicates that genetic factors
alone are unlikely to account for a substantial proportion of asthma cases. Major susceptibility
genes for asthma and atopy have not been determined to date.
Family concordance
People with family history of asthma are more likely to develop asthma themselves, and paren-
tal asthma is a stronger predictor of asthma in the offspring than parental atopy 94. This associa-
12
tion, however, is not necessarily due to genetic factors, and could merely reflect similar life-
styles and exposures in family members.
Twin concordance
Twin studies have shown the considerable genetic component of asthma. This component most
likely consists of genes of additive effect 95. The probandwise concordance for asthma in
monozygotic twins has been 38-52% 96,97, and even this may in part be due to similar environ-
mental exposures, including common intrauterine environment. Twin studies have also indi-
cated that not only the shared, but also the individual specific environmental factors may be im-
portant as well 96. Most of the environmental risk factors are, however, shared by nature. Fur-
thermore, two presumptions of the genetic studies using twin-designs, first, that twins are repre-
sentative of the general population and second, that the environment for both monozygous and
dizygous twins is similar, may not be totally valid. Thus, the shared intrauterine environment
may have an adverse effect on the growth and organ maturation of the foetus and higher simi-
larity in environment for monozygous compared to dizygous twins is likely 95.
Segregation and linkage analysis
Segregation analysis tests explicit models of inheritance in families – for example, by observing
the frequency of the condition in offspring and siblings and comparing it to the distribution ex-
pected on the basis of various models of inheritance. Linkage analysis uses DNA marker data in
order to follow the transmission of genetic information between generations in order to deter-
mine if a genetic marker is linked to the gene involved in a particular disease. Attention has
been particularly focused on chromosomes 5 and 11, both of which may contain genes relevant
to asthma and atopy.
Atopic sensitisation
“Atopy” has previously been used as a poorly defined term to refer to allergic conditions that
tend to cluster in families, including hay fever, asthma, atopic eczema, and other specific and
non-specific allergic states. More recently, atopy has been characterised by the production of
circulating IgE in response to common environmental allergens. Although atopy has sometimes
been defined as “a genetic disposition” for this IgE response, most definitions focus on the pro-
duction of IgE irrespective of the mechanism (genetic or environmental) by which it is pro-
duced 23. The commonly accepted hypothesis of the relationship between atopy and asthma is,
that exposure of genetically susceptible individuals to allergen leads to the development of sen-
sitisation, and continued exposure leads to clinical asthma through the development of airway
13
inflammation, BHR and reversible airway obstruction 22. The nature of the relationship between
allergic sensitisation to specific allergens and asthma can either be a direct causative one, with
allergen exposure causing asthma in susceptible individuals, or an indirect one, where the ge-
netically determined atopic diathesis causes both asthma and expression of sensitisation 98.
The association between atopy and asthma depends on the population studied. There is a con-
siderable amount of studies showing an association between atopy and asthma 22,62,81,99-101. In a
Finnish twin cohort, 262 twin pairs discordant for incident asthma were analysed. The atopic
twin had an increased risk of asthma compared with the non-atopic co-twin (RR 2.91, 95% CI
1.81 to 4.68) 102. There are, however, negative reports 103, and inverse association between
asthma and atopy has been reported 54. Reviewing the available epidemiological evidence on
the association of  asthma and atopy, Pearce and co-authors showed that the proportion of
asthmatic and non-asthmatic subjects who are skin prick test positive vary considerably be-
tween different studies. The population attributable risk varied from 25% to 63% in children
and from 8% to 55% in adults. The results were similar if specific or total IgE was used as an
outcome. Furthermore, increase of the prevalence of atopic sensitisation without increase in the
prevalence of asthma 69, as well as increase in the prevalence of  asthma with only minor
changes in the prevalence of atopy 104 has been reported. Allergens differ in their potency to
cause asthma symptoms, thus pets are more potent than pollen 105. 
The association between allergic sensitisation and bronchial responsiveness has been studied on
a combined ECRHS data set 106. Sensitisation to mite, cat and timothy grass explained between
1.4 to 12.7% of the total variation in bronchial responsiveness in the different centres. The
variation of bronchial responsiveness was better explained by taking account of all the individ-
ual allergens than by classifying the subjects as atopic or non-atopic. Mite sensitisation was the
most important allergen in 15 centres, cat in 8, cat and mite equally in 1, timothy in 8 and Cla-
dosporium in 2 centres. Total IgE has been showed to associate with BHR independently of
specific IgE 106-108. The attributable risk of atopic sensitisation for BHR was found to be 19% in
Sweden and 21% in Spain 105. Possibility has been proposed that asthmatics become sensitised
disproportionately to those allergens that (because of particle size) are deposited in the in-
flamed/primed lower airway (so asthma causes sensitisation). Bronchial hyperresponsiveness
can in turn prevent the deposition of larger particles in the lower airways, thus prevent sensiti-
sation. 
14
Furry pets
Positive correlation has been reported between the community prevalence of cat ownership and
sensitisation to cat, as well as respiratory symptoms and physician diagnosed asthma in young
adults 109, stressing the importance of cat allergens in developing and exacerbating
asthma 105,110,111. Children exposed to cat during the first year of life were, however, less often
SPT positive to cat at 12-13 years and children exposed to pets during the first year of life had a
lower frequency of allergic rhinitis at 7-9 years of age and of asthma at 12-13 years 112.
Analyses of the combined ECRHS data have shown a positive association between current cat
ownership and specific sensitisation in subjects reporting no respiratory symptoms associated
with pet exposure. Subjects with symptoms associated with exposure to pets were deliberately
excluded from the analyses to avoid the selection bias in cat ownership. Having a cat in child-
hood was, however, negatively associated with cat sensitisation in the same analysis in subjects
with a family history of atopy, while this association was not found in subjects without such a
family history . Based on the analyses of the same database, Svanes et al. reported that atopy
was negatively associated with having a dog in childhood, but that there was no significant as-
sociation with having a cat as a child, and atopy 113. The possibility, that higher allergen expo-
sure had induced tolerance in those having a dog in childhood is unlikely, as having a dog in
childhood was protective also against sensitisation to other allergens. The finding may reflect
pet avoidance by allergic families, however, there is no reason why dogs, but not cats, should
be selectively avoided, as cats are often more potent to cause symptoms 105. It is therefore more
likely, that some lifestyle factors confound the favourable effect of dog keeping, that are not
present among cat keepers, or that more potent cat allergen overwhelms the potential protective
effect. 
Smoking
Smoking is a well recognised and prevalent risk factor for respiratory symptoms 75,100,114,115, as
well as BHR 77,84,84,116. The association between current smoking and asthma is less clear. As-
sociation between smoking and asthma has been found cross-sectionally 101, also an association
between adult onset asthma 117,118 and severity of asthma 119 has been found. Many cross-
sectional 75,120,121, and some longitudinal studies 115 have, however, not found a clear association
between smoking and asthma. Furthermore, in a case control study of subjects from 16 coun-
tries, the risk of asthma with an onset within the last 3 years before the survey was found to be
43% lower in current smokers than in never smokers 82. However, in a three-year follow up
15
study Plaschke et al found that onset of asthma was more common in current smokers than in
non-smokers, but this effect of smoking was mainly found in non-atopic subjects 122. Similarly,
Sunyer and co-workers found, that smoking was associated with bronchial responsiveness only
in subjects without atopy 123. 
In the analysis of the combined ECRHS data set Jarvis et al reported a higher risk of sensitisa-
tion to mite in smokers than in never smokers 124. The risk of sensitisation to grass and cat was,
however, lower in current and ex-smokers than in never smokers. Smoking has been found to
be positively associated with total IgE 124-126 though less than 1% of the variation in total IgE
could be explained by smoking 124.
Every risk factor that is voluntary, is selection biased to factors like social status, personal hab-
its and awareness. Smoking in this sense is an extreme example. Unhealthy nutrition patterns
have been found consistently higher in smokers than in non-smokers. Smokers consume more
saturated fat, more alcohol, more cholesterol, less fruit, and fewer vegetables, more fried foods,
less fibre, less antioxidant vitamins, more salt. Smokers have less knowledge on how to im-
prove risk and lower intention to change 127. Thus, part of the association or lack of association
found between respiratory symptoms, asthma and smoking, can be attributed to other factors
than smoking itself.
Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
Passive smoking is widespread and passive smokers are exposed to both side-stream and main-
stream tobacco smoke which contains many potent respiratory irritants. A considerable amount
of studies have evaluated the effects of ETS on asthma in childhood 128. There is strong evi-
dence for a causal role of ETS in the development of asthma in children and parental smoking
is related to more severe prognosis of asthma at least until school-age 129.
Much less is, however, known on the relationship between ETS and asthma in adulthood. Six
studies, one longitudinal 130, four cross-sectional 131-134 and one nested case-reference study 135
have addressed the role of  ETS in induction of asthma in adults, and shown the excess risk of
asthma from 10 to over 200% in young adults and from 40 to 60% in older age groups due to
ETS exposure 128. ETS has also shown to worsen the existing asthma 136, and impair the lung
function 137. A recent paper, based on the analysis of the whole ECRHS data set showed that
passive smoking in the workplace, but not at home, was significantly related to current asthma
as well as all respiratory symptoms except attacks of breathlessness at rest 132. A significant
16
dose-related association to passive smoking was found for respiratory symptoms. ETS was also
related to increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
Indoor environment
Importance of indoor environment is stressed by the fact that in developed countries people
spend the major part of the time indoors. The data on the indoor environmental risk factors for
asthma in adults is, however, limited. Physical characteristics of the indoor environment include
temperature and humidity. The latter increases when ventilation is inadequate. Home dampness,
reflected as damp stains or visible mould was shown to associate with cough and asthma in a
population based study in adults in the Netherlands 138. The association between asthma, and
both dampness and visible mould, was strong in crude analysis but was not statistically signifi-
cant when two markers were combined and adjusted for active and passive smoking, indoor
NO2 sources and educational level in multiple regression analyses. Self-reported mould growth
at home has been associated with asthma in young adults in a selected population attending the
smoking cessation programme 131, first year university students 139 and in a case control study
of physician diagnosed asthma patients 140. In the latter study the severity of asthma correlated
with actual measures of total dampness in the dwelling. In Uppsala current asthma was more
prevalent in subjects living in damp dwellings and particularly so in those living in dwellings
with dampness in the floor construction 141. Dampness in the home during childhood has been
associated with increased airway responsiveness in adolescence 142. In a recent population
based case-references study of adult onset asthma, Thorn et al. reported increased  risk to out-
come in subjects who reported visible mould growth (OR 1.4-3.5), visible dampness and mould
growth (OR 1.1-3.1) or who had a wood stove in their dwelling 135. 
Homes abound in chemical air pollutants. Sources include unvented combustion appliances,
smoking, building materials, carpets etc. In 1996 Jarvis and co-workers reported that in the UK,
women who used gas cookers had an increased risk of wheeze and other asthma symptoms as
well as lower lung function (FEV1 and FEV1/FVC) than women not using gas cookers 91. No
such association was found in men. In a subsequent analysis of the combined data set, Jarvis et
al. reported that there was an overall association between the use of gas cookers and respiratory
symptoms in women, but that this association varied considerably between the centres 92. In
general there was a positive association between gas cooking and symptoms in most European
centres but a negative association in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. The reason
for this across country heterogeneity was not explained but could possibly be related to differ-
ences in the nature of the gas in different countries.
17
Building materials can act as sources of formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds
(VOC). Nocturnal breathlessness has been shown to associate with higher levels of CO2, for-
maldehyde and total concentration of VOC 143. An association between respiratory symptoms
and living or working in a newly painted dwelling, and BHR and living in a dwelling with
newly painted wood details or kitchen painting has been reported 144. Björnsson et al. have re-
ported higher levels of house dust mite and airborne bacteria in houses of subjects with asthma
related symptoms 145. This association was, however, not related to mite allergy as none of the
subjects who lived in houses with measurable house dust mite levels were sensitised to house
dust mite. 
Outdoor environment
Air pollution is convincingly associated with many signs of asthma aggravation. The adverse
effects of SO2 , ozone, and particulate matter to asthma patients have been proved in many ex-
perimental studies 146. There is less evidence of effects of NO2 from experimental studies.
However, a slight increase in daily admissions to hospital for asthma in adults has been seen in
relation to increasing ambient levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 147. In adults no consistent ef-
fects of long-term exposure to ambient ozone concentrations on the development of asthma and
atopy have been demonstrated 148.
If air pollution influences the prevalence of asthma, it has clearly not been the main driving in-
fluence over the last decades, as the main increase in asthma prevalence in Western countries
has come at a time when air pollution has been considerably decreased, and Eastern Europe that
had particularly bad air pollution had a markedly low prevalence of asthma. That, however,
concerns mainly particulate matter and SO2. It has been argued that NO2, diesel particles of
other products associated with traffic pollution may be responsible for the West-East difference
in the prevalence of asthma.
Occupational exposures
Asthma is the most common occupational respiratory disorder in industrialised countries. Oc-
cupational asthma can be caused by several high and low molecular weight sensitises, of which
more than 250 have been identified 149. The determination of how many cases of asthma may be
caused or worsened by occupational exposures is highly dependent on how asthma is defined,
what constitutes work-relatedness, and what specific methodology is employed. The proportion
of asthma attributed to occupational exposure has been estimated to be 5–10% 150-153. Asthma
18
has been associated with high dose exposure to biological, and mineral dust as well as exposure
to gases and fumes 151. A higher risk for asthma has been found among laboratory technicians,
painters, plastic workers, cleaners and agricultural workers 152,153. 
Socio-economic status 
A high prevalence of asthma has been found in affluent Western countries. On the community
level a higher prevalence of asthma has been shown in more affluent regions in developing
countries 148,154. Higher paternal social class was also associated with increased asthma preva-
lence in a British 1970 birth cohort studied at 26 years of age 155, and in children who had
wheezed by five years of age, the persistence of symptoms at 16 years of age was independ-
ently related to high social status of the mother 156. Higher educational level was also a risk
factor for clinical allergies among adults in East Germany 63. However, the more educated twin
of 262 twin pairs discordant for incident asthma, had a decreased risk of asthma compared to
twin sibling with less education 102, and asthma has shown to be more severe in patients from
poorer background 157. 
Number of siblings,  day-care attendance and infections
One temporal association with the increase in atopy in developed countries has been the use of
antibiotics, widespread vaccination of children and the fall in exposure to helminths. In his re-
cent review, Weiss concludes that there is no conclusive evidence that parasitic infections pro-
tect against asthma development 158. The association with antibiotic use and asthma is difficult
to study as the use of antibiotics is widespread and the predominant reason for prescription is
prolonged respiratory symptoms after a viral infection, where a bacterial involvement in the
disease is suspected. Misclassification with asthma in this situations is likely, leading to a non-
casual positive association between asthma and antibiotic use. There are social groups where
conventional treatments, including antibiotics, are deliberately rejected. One study, carried out
on a selected group of children at Rudolf Steiner schools, showed 400% increase in asthma
prevalence associated with use of  antibiotics 159. There are, however, many other aspects of the
anthroposophic lifestyle which may be relevant and antibiotic use in this context may be a
marker of non-adherence to the anthroposophic lifestyle. Nevertheless, the effects of antimicro-
bial therapy on bacterial colonisation of the infant gut should also be regarded.
Several studies have found negative associations of family size, and particularly with the num-
ber of older siblings 160,161 with atopy 59,62,161,162, hay fever 55,112, asthma 81,112,155,163 and
BHR 164. In the analysis of the whole ECRHS data set, atopy was negatively associated with
19
family size, partly attributable to an independent protective effect of a greater number of broth-
ers, but not older siblings. Bedroom sharing was associated with a lower prevalence of atopy,
particularly to cat allergen 113. However, a protective effect of family size and bedroom sharing
could only be detected in subjects reporting no parental allergy, indicating that in subjects with
a strong genetic predisposition, environmental factors in childhood are possibly of less impor-
tance. 
Similarly, day-care attendance has been associated with decreased risk of atopy, but that only in
children from families with up to three people. The association was higher among children who
attended day-care earlier 165 but an opposite association also has been reported 55, where day-
care attendance at age 0-2 years was a weak risk factor for allergic rhinitis but not for asthma.
Furthermore, children who attend day-care have shown to have increased risk of asthma with
early infections as a probable mediator of risk 166. In Swedish young adults an increased risk of
atopic sensitisation was found in subjects who had attended a day-care centre before the age of
five  years 125, but this association was not found to be significant when analysing the combined
ECRHS data set 113. No association of adult asthma and day-care attendance has been reported. 
 
Strachan, who first found the negative association between hay fever and number of older chil-
dren in the household, suggested that small family size could reduce infectious diseases
“transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings”, but not respiratory viral infections in
infancy, and that this could in turn increase the risk of atopic disease at older ages 160. This hy-
pothesis has been developed further. The immunological bases of the hypothesis  stands on T
helper (Th) lymphocyte differentiation in maturation of  the immune system. Th2-like cytokines
(interleukin (IL) 4, IL-13, and IL-5) produced in the uterine environment are important to
maintain the pregnancy. The continuation of foetal allergen-specific Th2 responses during in-
fancy is associated with decreased capacity for production of the Th1 cytokine interferon γ by
atopic neonates 167. According to the hygiene hypothesis, T-cell responses to the microbial and
viral infections generate Th1-like cytokines such as IL-12 and interferon-γ that down-regulate
Th2 responses, helping T-cell immune responses to mature into a balanced phenotype that
would be less likely to favour allergen sensitisation 168,169.  
There is also more direct evidence that childhood exposure to infections might prevent atopic
diseases. Less atopy 170 and asthma 171, in those with history of measles and less atopy in those
with hepatitis A 172 has been reported. Furthermore, in a study of Italian male military students
20
the prevalence of serum markers of microbes transmitted through the oral rout was higher in the
non-atopic than in the atopic cadets, while presence of serum markers of the viruses transmitted
by other routes was not associated with atopy 173.
Strongly positive tuberculin responses in early life were associated significantly with less
asthma in later childhood in Japanese children 174. The positive tuberculin responses in early
life were also associated with a dominance of  lymphocyte class T helper (Th1) over Th2 in the
blood cytokine profiles at 12 years of age. However, differences in immune responses and natu-
ral resistance in different subjects result in differences in handling both infections and potential
allergens, and thus differences in the clinical expression of a disease. This difference in host
characteristics is reflected also in differences in cytokine levels. The intensity of tuberculin re-
sponses in young adults receiving BCG at 14 years of age did not correlate with total serum IgE
in the Norwegian population, nor did the positive tuberculin test distinguish the atopics from
nonatopics 175. These two papers together indicate, that it is not the host characteristics in the Th
lymphocyte balance, but rather the subclinical exposure to M.Tuberculosis or immunisation
earlier in life, that can result in decrease in atopy. The latter hypothesis has, however, been re-
jected by two Swedish studies on children 176,177. As a proxy of differences in natural exposure
to M. tuberculosis, WHO derived tuberculosis notification rates were matched to the prevalence
of respiratory symptoms within the ISAAC study in ecological analyses. The results showed
that increase in notification was negatively correlated with the prevalence of wheeze and
asthma in 85 centres from 23 countries studied 178. A Finnish registry based study has shown
reduced occurrence of subsequent asthma in women with M.Tuberculosis infection in child-
hood, the relation was, however, inverse among men 179. Thus, BCG vaccination once, either in
infancy or adolescence, seems not to shift the Th1-Th2 balance. There is also no conclusive evi-
dence that treated active tuberculosis before the age of 20 could do that. However, repeated
contacts with mycobacteria at a certain age might have an influence on the immune system.
This is supported by the results of von Mutius et al. An other possibility is, that these relations
can be confounded by other aspects of lifestyle. 
While some kinds of infections may have a role in the maturation of the immune system in
early childhood with consequences that can last to adulthood and determine the subsequent de-
velopment of respiratory diseases 148,180, viral upper respiratory infections are a common trigger
for episodes of bronchospasm and have been associated with 80% of all asthma exacerbations
181,182. Prospective studies in children, where viral markers have been measured at clinical respi-
21
ratory infection episodes in early childhood, have shown variable, but declining with age, asso-
ciation between respiratory virus infections in infancy, and frequent wheeze up to at least 13
years of age 183,184. The extent of the association depends on the severity of the disease episode.
The strongest association has been found between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchioli-
tis in infancy, severe enough to cause hospitalisation 183. A positive association with respiratory
syncytial virus infection and BHR has been shown among adults 185. As no population based
studies with serological proof and adult asthma as an outcome are available, the causal role of
viral infections in asthma has remained unclear. The role of bacterial infections in exacerbating
asthma is more controversial. A positive association with serological signs of a current or recent
Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and reported wheeze has been reported 186 but not confirmed
by others 187. 
Diet
There are different ways in which food could affect lung health. First, relative deficiencies of
certain foods may alter the lung’s defence mechanisms, making it more liable to develop dis-
ease. Second, food sensitivity may act through immunological or nonimmunological mecha-
nisms to cause bronchoconstriction 188. Third, changes from locally produced food, like fresh
and fermented vegetables, and non sterilised diary products to industrially prepared and proc-
essed foods and use of microwave ovens, can change microbial load and influence the gut mi-
cro flora. 
One of the first observations on the association of general dietal habits and asthma was, that the
regional sales of table salt were related to asthma morbidity statistics in Britain. This gave rise
to the suggestion that salt intake is relevant for the risk of asthma 189. Later studies have not
proved this and it has been suggested that salt intake can be a marker of generally poor
diet 188,189. Another early observation was, that low prevalence of asthma in Eskimos could be
associated with their diet, rich in fish and marine mammals or, with a genetic deviation in fat
metabolism in Eskimos, or both 190. The increase of asthma prevalence has been subsequent to
the fall in the consumption of animal fat and oily fish with high content of saturated fat and in-
crease in the amount of margarine and vegetable oils, containing polyunsaturated fat, in the diet
of Western countries. It has been suggested, that an increase in the intake of ω-6 fatty acids,
such as lineleic acid, and a decrease in the intake of ω-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic
acid, may have led to an increase in allergic sensitisation, which in turn may account for the in-
crease in the prevalence of asthma. The reason, why a decreased consumption of ω-3 fatty acids
may lead to increased prevalence of allergy may be the ability of ω-3 fatty acids to inhibit the
22
synthesis of arachidonic acid from linoleic acid and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from arachidonic
acid. The ability of PGE2  to inhibit the productions of interferon γ would in turn lead to the
immune modulation towards Th2 inflammatory reaction to allergens 191. Association between
the intake of polyunsaturated fat and atopy has been shown in children 192,193 and adults 194.
Epidemiological evidence to show the importance of these mechanisms in asthma is scarce. The
association with asthma and dietary fat has been revealed in some studies in children 116,195, but
not others 192 and not among adults. Thus, among young Norwegian adults, with an overall high
fish intake, fish consumption was not a significant predictor of current respiratory symptoms or
asthma 196, similarly, no relation between the intake of various fats and asthma was found in the
Nurses’ Health Study 197. However, improvement of asthma in children using fish oil capsules
vs. capsules with olive oil in a double blind clinical trial in a strictly controlled environment has
been shown 198. It has been suggested that intake of a mild anti-inflammatory agent, like fish
oil, might matter more in children, than in adults 199.
Acting as antioxidants, or through influences on immune function, vitamins C and E and beta
carotene in the diet may reduce airway inflammation, thereby decreasing the severity of asthma
or preventing the expression of asthma in susceptible individuals. Vitamin E intake from diet
was inversely associated with adult onset asthma in the prospective Nurses’ Health Study.
Thus, women in the highest quintile of daily vitamin E intake from diet alone had a 47% lower
risk of asthma than women in the lowest quintile 197.
The effect of  processed food consumption instead of eating locally produced food and food
products and potential effect of the dietal changes on gut microflora and the subsequent devel-
opment of  atopy and  asthma has been less studied. However, studies comparing infants in
Sweden and Estonia have shown marked differences in the types of faecal bacteria in unse-
lected infants in the two countries, which broadly match the differences seen between atopic
and non-atopic infants in each country 200,201. The differences included a more intensive coloni-
zation with lactobacilli and eubacteria in Estonian children, whereas the Swedish infants had
increased numbers of clostridia, particularly C. difficile, as well as bacterioides and other anaer-
obes 201.  
In Britain and in the USA the rise in asthma has been accompanied by an epidemic increase in
the prevalence of obesity, a characteristic related to diet, and often unbalanced diet. An inde-
pendent association between increase of body mass index (BMI) and prevalence of current
23
wheeze, chest tightness and breathlessness at night, after controlling for age, sex, occupational
exposure, smoking and dietary fish consumption, has been relieved in young Norwegian
adults 196. The prevalence of asthma increased with BMI also among British adults studied at 26
years of age. The association between fatness and asthma was stronger among women 155. In an
Australian study among adults 17-73 years, it was found that severe obesity, defined as a BMI
of >35 kg/m2, was associated with a higher prevalence of wheeze, diagnosed asthma and medi-
cation use. Despite the fact that FEV1 and FVC were significantly reduced in severely obese
subjects, there was no increase in airway responsiveness to histamine among them. A low level
of physical activity, clearly associated with higher BMI, can be a result of asthmatic individuals
avoiding physical exercise. However, asthmatic children have been shown to be physically as
active as non-asthmatic children 202. Furthermore, it has been shown, that weight reduction has
both short time and long-time favourable effects on lung function, and symptoms 203.

European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS)
ECRHS is a multicentre survey of the prevalence, determinants and management of asthma. A
screening questionnaire, including seven questions relating to the 12 month prevalence of
symptoms of asthma, was distributed to representative samples of 20-44 year old men and
women in 48 centres, predominantly in Western Europe, followed by the tests for allergy, lung
function measurements, tests of airway responsiveness, and blood and urine collection in the
clinical phase of the study in 38 centres from 18 countries. The total number of subjects that re-
sponded to stage 1 was 137,619. The random sample of stage 2 comprised 18,811 subjects. A
symptomatic stage 2 sample was included in 25 centres and comprised 2,998 subjects. 
 
The three main objectives of the survey were:
1. To estimate the variation in the prevalence of asthma, asthma-like symptoms, atopic sensi-
tisation and bronchial lability in Europe.
2. To estimate variation in exposure to known or suspected risk factors for asthma; to measure
their association with asthma and to assess further the extent to which they explain varia-
tions in the prevalence across Europe.
3. To estimate the variation in treatment practice for asthma in the European Community.
Study areas (I-IV)
Following the protocol of the ECRHS 42, two areas were compared, i.e. Tartu in Estonia and
Uppsala in Sweden. Both are university towns (population 110,000 and 167,000, respectively)
with little industry. They are located at a similar latitude and they have a similar climate. The
track of development of the countries parted 50 years ago and the study group in Tartu has been
living in a socialist economy from birth. In 1993, the mean monthly salary was 80$ in Tartu and
2,612$ in Uppsala  and the purchasing power of the salary for the inner market five times
higher in Sweden than in Estonia (personal communication, Ministry of Economics in Estonia).
The living area per inhabitant was 12 m2 in Tartu, as compared to 40 m2 in Uppsala. In Tartu
63% of people used gas stoves for cooking, as compared to less than 1% in Uppsala. There
were also major differences in the use of asthma medication between the countries 204 (Fig-
ure 1).

Phase 1 
Subjects (I)
Random samples, of 3000 individuals in Tartu and 3600 in Uppsala between ages 20 and 44,
with equal number from either sex, were taken from the Civil Registers. To avoid linguistic
problems, only people of Estonian nationality were selected in Tartu.
Questionnaire (I)
The ECRHS modified version of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Dis-
ease (IUATLD) questionnaire 75,205 was used. It included seven questions commonly related to
the diagnosis of asthma. Questions on smoking history were added both in Uppsala and Tartu.
The questionnaire was translated from English into Estonian and Swedish and re-translated into
English. The Estonian questionnaire was also translated into Swedish for comparison. The
questionnaires were mailed in December 1990 in Uppsala and in December 1993 in Tartu, to-
gether with a letter of explanation and a stamped reply envelope. Two additional questionnaires
were sent to non-responders.

Subjects (II-IV)
A random sample of 800 persons in both centres was selected for further investigations, which
included a structured interview and the determination of circulating IgE antibodies to allergens.
Only individuals who had answered to the mailed questionnaire were invited to participate (n=
723 in Tartu, n=706 in Uppsala) (II-IV).

In addition, a symptomatic sample comprising all persons from the original study group who
reported use of asthma medication, attacks of asthma, or awakening because of shortness of
breath and who were not already included in the random sample were invited to participate (n=
197 in Tartu and n= 216 in Uppsala) (II, IV). The study was conducted from April 1991 to Feb-
ruary 1992 in Uppsala and from March 1994 to July 1995 in Tartu. The study flow is presented
on figure 2.
Questionnaire (II-IV)
The ECRHS questionnaire for a structured interview was used 42,205,206. The questionnaire was
translated from English into Estonian and Swedish and re-translated into English. The interview
included questions on symptoms, diagnoses, smoking history, parental smoking history, family
structure, family history, early environment, education, employment, home environment, diet,
use of medicines, attitudes to medicines and the use of health services. In addition individuals
with pollen associated symptoms were asked about what time of the year the symptoms ap-
peared. Allergy to birch and timothy were only considered when the symptoms appeared in the
spring and summer, respectively.
Serum IgE levels and circulating IgE antibodies (II-IV)
Serum IgE levels and IgE antibodies against D. pteronyssinus, timothy, birch, cat and Clado-
sporium  were determined by Pharmacia CAP™ system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden).
Serum ECP (IV)
The blood samples that were collected for ECP measurements were kept at 24oC for 60 minutes
before they were centrifuged. Sera were stored at –20oC. The concentration of S-ECP was as-
sayed with a double antibody radioimmuno assay (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden).
Spirometry (II-V)
Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was measured with Jäeger Flowscreen, Lilly
type pneumotachograph (Erich JÄEGER GmbH & CoKG, Würzburg, Germany) in Tartu and
with Spiro Medics computerised dry-rolling seal spirometer system 2130 (Sensor Medics, Ana-
heim, California, USA) in Uppsala. The predicted value was calculated for each subject 207. 
Methacholine challenge test (II-V)
Two automatic inhalation synchronised dosimeter jet nebulisers were used. In the clinical phase
of ECRHS (II-IV), Spira Elektro2 (Respiratory Care Centre, Hämeenlinna, Finland) 208 was
30
used in Tartu and Mefar MB3 dosimeter (Mefar, Brescia, Italy) 209 in Uppsala. The methods
were compared in a separate analyses (V).
The Spira dosimeter was adjusted to nebulise for 0.5 seconds from the beginning of each
inhalation. Patients controlled their tidal breathing with the flow indicator and volume digital
readout to achieve a stable flow of 0.5 l/s with tidal volume 0.4-0.6 l. Employing the Mefar
protocol, slow inspirations from functional residual capacity to total lung capacity with breath
holding for at least three seconds were done. Aerosol delivery time was set to one second and
pause time to six seconds.
FEV1 was measured, before the challenge and either two (Mefar) or three minutes (Spira) after
inhalation of normal saline and each dose of methacholine. The best of two attempts was regis-
tered. The decline of FEV1  was calculated from the control value, i.e. the value of FEV1 after
four inhalations of saline (36 µg) using Mefar dosimeter and five inhalations (32 µg) using
Spira-2. Methacholine challenges were terminated after a fall of FEV1 ≥ 20% from the control
value or after the last dose inhaled. The test was not performed if the post diluent FEV1 was re-
duced by more than 10% compared with the pre-diluent FEV1. Appropriate transition equations
were used to transform the Tartu data, making them comparable to those obtained in Uppsala.
After transforming the data maximum cumulative dose administered using the Spira (2.3 mg)
corresponded to 1.5 mg using that of the Mefar method. This cut-off point was used to define
BHR. 
Comparison of two dosimeter methods
Subjects (V)
Twenty-eight patients (16 males) with mild to moderate asthma were recruited through the
Asthma Register of Tartu University Lung Clinic. The mean age was 30.5 years (range 17-43
years). All patients had a documented variation in forced expired volume in one second (FEV1)
of more than 15% after β2-agonist and fulfilled the criteria of asthma (International Consensus
Report on Diagnosis and Management of Asthma, 1992). They  had to be symptomatic or on
inhaled short acting β2-agonists during two weeks preceding the investigations. None of them
used any other asthma medication than either inhaled glucocorticoids, or short acting inhaled
β2-agonists, or both, and the dose regimen did not change during the study. Inhaled β2-agonists
31
were withheld for at least five hours before each challenge. The prechallenge FEV1  was 74% of
predicted value in two and over 80% in all other cases.
Ethical considerations
All participants gave their informed consent. The respective local Ethics Committees approved
the studies.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The statistical analysis was performed with the Statistica 4.0 software package (Stat Soft Inc.,
Tulsa, USA) (I), the SAS System 6.11 software package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)
(II, III, V) and the StatView 5 software package (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) (IV).
Chi-square-test was used to analyse differences between groups. Linear regression was used to
correlate two continuous variables and logistic and multiple linear regression for multiple vari-
ables. Logistic regression analysis was performed in order to estimate adjusted odds ratios when
taking into account several variables. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were de-
termined. Log-transformation was performed to achieve a normal distribution of S-ECP and S-
IgE. S-ECP values are presented as geometric mean (+SD). A p-value <0.05 was regarded as
statistically significant. In paper V, after logarithmic transformation of PD20 values, paired t-test
was used to compare measurements obtained with the two challenge methods. Linear regression
was used to calculate transition equations. A measure of slope was calculated by regressing
percentage fall in FEV1 on log10 (dose). In order to satisfy the assumptions of standard statisti-
cal analyses, i.e. normality and homogeneity of variance, the regression coefficient was trans-
formed. The term “slope” is used for the following transformed log slope: 100/(regression coef-
ficient + 10). A p-value <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

RESULTS
Paper I
Asthmatic symptoms were less prevalent in Tartu (4.6% vs. 6.8%), as were attacks of asthma
(1.9% vs. 3.3%), current asthma medication (0.7% vs. 4.9%), and allergic rhinitis (17.8% vs.
22.2%). The prevalence of  current wheeze was higher and wheeze with breathlessness lower in
Tartu than in Uppsala, while the prevalence of wheeze without a cold was similar. In Tartu, but
not in Uppsala, wheezing and wheeze without a cold were more common among men than
among women. Nocturnal respiratory symptoms (wakening with chest tightness or being woken
by an attack of breathlessness or an attack of cough) were more prevalent in Tartu (p<0.001),
especially among women. The prevalence of nocturnal symptoms also increased with age
(p<0.05) in Tartu, but not in Uppsala. Age was inversely related to allergic rhinitis in Uppsala
but not in Tartu. Current smoking was an invariable risk factor for all respiratory symptoms,
except for attacks of asthma, both in Tartu and Uppsala. The prevalence of current smoking was
higher in Tartu compared to Uppsala (45.9% vs. 33.8%). Allowing for age, sex, current smok-
ing and self reported allergic rhinitis did not change the differences in symptom prevalence
between the centres. 
Paper II
The prevalence of atopy was 19% in Tartu and 32% in Uppsala. The major allergen in Tartu
was house dust mite (10%) , while in Uppsala it was pollen (grass 18% and birch 15%). The
prevalence of sensitisation to pollen was twice as low (11.5 vs. 23.2%) and the prevalence of
pollen associated asthma symptoms was four times lower (1.7 vs. 6.8) in Tartu than in Uppsala,
while sensitisation to pollen was an equally large risk factor for asthma in both centres. 
Risk factors were estimated for nine outcome variables: three different conditions, i.e. atopic
sensitisation, allergy associated symptoms of asthma and allergy associated symptoms of  rhi-
noconjunctivitis, in association with three different allergens: mite, pets and pollen. Risk factors
were different for different sensitises and some differences in them could be revealed between
the two centres. For atopic sensitisation the risk factors were mainly demographic or genetic by
nature, or associated with infant environment. Male gender and allergic heredity were most of-
ten associated with outcome variables, both in Tartu and Uppsala. Age was inversely related to
cat and pollen associated symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis in Uppsala. Pet in infancy was in-
versely associated with pollen atopy in Uppsala, while no association with atopic sensitisation
and pet ownership in childhood could be revealed in Tartu. Current exposures had some oppo-
33
site effects on sensitisation, thus cat ownership was a risk factor for sensitisation to cat in Tartu,
whereas pet ownership was inversely related to atopic sensitisation to pollen in Uppsala.
Working as a manager, legislative official or an administrator was inversely related to sensiti-
sation to pollen in Tartu, and was associated with an increased prevalence of IgE antibodies
against cat in Uppsala. Additional current exposures as risk factors could be revealed for aller-
gic respiratory symptoms associated with indoor allergens but not for pollen. In Tartu, use of
open fire in the household tended to be a risk factor both for symptoms of asthma and allergic
rhinitis associated with sensitisation to cat or mite. The age of the dwelling had an opposite ef-
fect on allergic respiratory symptoms in the two centres. In Tartu, living in house built after
1971, and in Uppsala, before 1971, increased the risk for symptoms. 
The examined risk factors, however, did not explain the difference in prevalence between the
centres, thus after controlling for several risk factors, living in Uppsala was still associated with
OR of 2.1 for pollen atopy, 2.4  for pollen asthma and 5.4 for pollen ARC.
Paper III
The prevalence of BHR was higher in Tartu regardless how BHR was defined. Using the cut-
off point 1.5 mg the prevalence of BHR was 19% in Tartu and 11% in Uppsala (p<0.001).
Bronchial responsiveness estimated by mean slope was 7.2 and 7.8, respectively (p<0.001).
Female gender, sensitisation to cat, current smoking, and visible mould in the home during the
last 12 months were independent risk factors for BHR in Tartu. In Uppsala, BHR was signifi-
cantly associated with total  IgE levels, current smoking, and  exposure to environmental to-
bacco smoke. In Tartu, the prevalence of BHR among current smokers was significantly higher
only compared to lifelong non-smokers who were not exposed to ETS, while in Uppsala the
prevalence of BHR was higher among passive smokers than among individuals not exposed to
ETS. The prevalence of current asthma in subjects with BHR was 7% in Tartu and 23% in
Uppsala. None of several other environmental factors, e.g., use of gas and open fire, age of the
dwelling, water damage, childhood environmental factors like parental smoking, number of
siblings and severe respiratory infection before five years of age or  social class were signifi-
cantly associated with BHR in the univariate analyses. When the two populations were com-
bined in one multiple regression model, living in Tartu was an independent risk factor for BHR
(OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.15-3.0).
Paper IV
The median S-ECP value was 8.0 µg/l in the random sample which was considerably lower
than in an investigation with identical design in Uppsala 32. The geometric mean of S-ECP was
34
higher in subjects with, than without atopy (10.2. vs. 8.9 µg/l, p<0.01) and in subjects with
bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) than in subjects without BHR (9.9 vs. 8.0 µg/l, p<0.01).
The levels correlated weakly to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (r=0.13,
p<0.01) and were not independently correlated with respiratory symptoms, asthma or FEV1 af-
ter adjusting for BHR, IgE, sensitisation and smoking. The specificity and sensitivity of a S-
ECP value above the interquartile range (12.0 µg/l) for atopy were 32% and 80% respectively,
for BHR 30% and 80%, for self reported asthma 63% and 97% and for wheeze 36% and 76%.
Paper V
The provocative dose of methacholine producing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one
second (PD20) was lower when determined by Spira than with the Mefar dosimeter. Transition
equations calculated by linear regression analysis were: PD20mefar = exp10[0.897 +
0.678(logPD20spira)] and PD20spira = exp10[0.759 + 0.559 (log PD20mefar)].The slopes were
calculated by regressing the percentage fall in FEV1 on log10 (dose) and transformed as slope =
100/(regression coefficient + 10). The mean slope (95% CI) for Spira was 3.1 (2.6-3.7) and for
Mefar 4.4 (3.6-5.1) (P < 0.005). Regression equations calculated by linear regression analysis
were: slope(mefar) = 2.126 + 0.712 slope(spira) and slope(spira) = 1.551 + 0.365 slope(mefar).

DISCUSSION
The postal questionnaire study (paper I) showed high prevalence of respiratory symptoms in-
cluding wheeze, but low prevalence of diagnosed asthma and asthma treatment in Tartu com-
pared to Uppsala. As the prevalence of asthma like symptoms, i.e. having wheeze with breath-
lessness while not having a cold, was also low in Tartu, it seemed likely that the relatively low
prevalence of asthma in Tartu is real. Results of the clinical phase of the study confirmed that
the prevalence of atopic sensitisation and respiratory allergies (paper II) as well as the levels of
serum ECP (paper IV) were low in Tartu, concordant to the notion of low prevalence of asthma.
The high prevalence of  BHR in Tartu concorded with the high prevalence of wheeze and noc-
turnal symptoms (paper III). The prevalence of current asthma in subjects with BHR was only
7% in Tartu but 23% in Uppsala. Furthermore, the association between BHR and atopic sensiti-
sation was statistically significant only in Uppsala, indicating that atopy is less associated to
BHR in Tartu than in Uppsala. 
S-ECP was elevated in subjects with atopy and BHR, but the levels were not related to asthma
symptoms or lung function when other asthma related variables were controlled for. It is, how-
ever, not surprising that after controlling for the effect of atopy and BHR, S-ECP no longer re-
mains associated with asthma symptoms and self reported asthma, as atopy, elevated S-ECP,
and BHR may share the same pathway to asthma: atopic sensitisation being the prerequisite to
allergic inflammation, the latter marked by elevated S-ECP. Activation of eosinophils in its turn
can result in increased BHR. 
The difference in the prevalence of asthma like symptoms between Tartu and Uppsala was
smaller than the difference in the prevalence of diagnosed asthma and even more so, asthma
treatment. Hence, we have suggested that the low prevalence of self reported asthma in Tartu
may partly be the reflection of low awareness of the disease in the society. The awareness of
allergic diseases in Tartu seemed to be lower than in Uppsala, based on the results of the clini-
cal phase of  the study as well, as the difference in the prevalence of  pollen associated respira-
tory symptoms, especially hay fever, was larger than the difference in the prevalence of  sensiti-
sation to pollen. Alternatively, there may be some unknown factors in Tartu that decrease the
risk of expression of symptoms in allergen sensitised subjects.
Our results are in line with previous comparative studies between countries with affluent mar-
ket economy and previous socialist countries, revealing low prevalence of allergies and asthma
36
in the latter both among children 52,57,59-61 and adults 62,63. However, in contrast to previous
comparisons of adult populations in East and West Germany, respiratory symptoms as well as 
BHR were high among Estonian adults. While generally the prevalence of BHR parallels that of
self reported asthma and wheeze 45,51 the prevalence of BHR was also high among Estonian
children 66. It has recently been suggested  that bronchial challenge  might provide more valid
information than questionnaires in epidemiological studies of asthma, when comparing popula-
tions which do not share the same language, culture, health care system, or perception and la-
belling of asthma symptoms 21. Our results indicate that the validity of BHR as a marker of
asthma may be low when target populations differ in regard to other possible causes of BHR,
e.g. differences in environmental pollution and ETS. Thus, a method that is valid within a par-
ticular population may not be the most appropriate one for regional or international compari-
sons of asthma. 
As shown in the figure 3, the prevalence estimates of asthma depend on what operational defi-
nition is used and what measurement techniques are employed. Disease prevalence per se is,
however, important mainly from an economical point of view, to enable the planning of the
health care.

Age was inversely related to self reported allergic rhinitis in Uppsala but there was no similar
trend in Tartu. Age was inversely related to cat and pollen associated symptoms of rhino-
conjunctivitis  and there was also a tendency towards an inverse relationship between age and
atopy in Uppsala but not in Tartu. Analysis of the data from three Swedish centres participating
in ECRHS revealed this trend to be statistically significant 125. This result supports the sugges-
tion that the increasing prevalence of allergic diseases among children and young adults in
Western Europe is caused by a cohort effect, the causes of which possibly date back to changes
beginning in the mid 1950s 210. However, the prevalence of atopic sensitisation among adults in
Tartu was much higher than in a prevalence study in children 58, while in Sweden the preva-
lence was similar in children and in adults 52, indicating that expression of atopic sensitisation
can occur later in life. Resampling of the 9-11-year schoolchildren in Leipzig four years after
the German unification showed significant increase in the prevalence of atopy compared to the
study conducted four years earlier 69. These children were born about three years before unifi-
cation and were therefore exposed to western living conditions only after the third birthday.
Thus, factors operating very early in life may be particularly important for maturation of the
immune system, whereas the development of atopic sensitisation may also be affected by envi-
ronmental factors occurring beyond infancy.
A definition of high specificity, like doctor diagnosed asthma, should preferably be used, in es-
timating risk factors 5. We could not use self reported asthma as an outcome, as there were only
eight subjects with diagnosed asthma in Estonia in a random sample and additional 13 came
from the enriched sample. The dependent variables we have used in risk factor analyses com-
prise respiratory symptoms, in the postal questionnaire data and BHR, atopic sensitisation and
allergic respiratory symptoms from the clinical part of the study. For atopy and respiratory al-
lergies nine outcome variables were used: atopic sensitisation to three different allergens: mite,
pets and pollen, and allergy associated symptoms of asthma, and allergy associated symptoms
of  rhinoconjunctivitis associated with the same different allergens.
Women had more nocturnal symptoms than men in Tartu, while the prevalence of wheeze was
higher among men. However, after controlling for current smoking, no gender difference in
wheeze remained. The gender difference in reported night symptoms can be explained by
higher BHR among women in Tartu. In analyses of the clinical phase of the study, female gen-
der was a risk factor for BHR in Tartu after controlling for baseline lung function and other
variables. This is in accordance with previous reports 83,84. In an analysis of Leynaert et al. of
38
the French ECRHS data set greater bronchial responsiveness was observed in women than in
men after adjusting for several variables for airway calibre and lung size as well as for body
mass index 90. In that study BHR in women was more related to smoking than in men. Thus, the
excess of BHR in women may be related to a greater susceptibility to tobacco smoke. Women
have been found to be more susceptible than men also to other environmental factors, as the use
of gas for cooking is associated with respiratory symptoms suggestive of airway obstruction in
women but not in men 91-93. Men were more often sensitised to common allergens and, corre-
spondingly, tended also to have more respiratory allergies. 
Current smoking was a significant risk factor for BHR and for all respiratory symptoms, except
for attacks of asthma, both in Tartu and Uppsala but not for atopic sensitisation and allergic
respiratory symptoms. This is in concordance with many previous studies 75,77,84,84,100,114-116. 
ETS was associated with a four-fold increased BHR in Uppsala, but was not significantly asso-
ciated with BHR in Tartu. This was in contrast to the results of a cross sectional study involving
2600 schoolchildren (10-12 years) from  Estonia, Poland and Sweden where maternal smoking
was related to respiratory symptoms only in Estonia and Poland 59. In the current study, subjects
were classified as exposed to ETS if they reported exposure to ETS on most days or nights
during the last 12 months. As smoking is not restricted in public places in Estonia unlike in
Sweden, our questionnaire may underestimate the true exposure to ETS in Tartu. An associa-
tion between exposure to tobacco smoke and sensitisation to mite but not to other allergens has
been observed previously 124. We found an association between maternal smoking in childhood
with sensitisation to mite, and mite associated symptoms of asthma in Tartu.
An association between atopic sensitisation and BHR has been found in many stud-
ies 77,106,116,211. Cat was the allergen most strongly related to BHR in Tartu. Pet ownership, both
in infancy and at the time of the study, was inversely associated with atopic sensitisation, espe-
cially to pollen, and correspondingly also to pollen associated respiratory symptoms in Uppsala,
while in Tartu current cat ownership was a risk factor for cat atopy. The inverse association of
respiratory symptoms with current pet ownership in Uppsala can be explained by selection bias,
i.e. sensitised individuals were less likely to keep pets, while in Tartu the awareness of pets as a
risk factor for allergic diseases is probably lower. Pet ownership in childhood has, however,
been found to be inversely related with atopic sensitisation, allergic rhinitis and asthma in later
life also in other studies 109,113. These findings have been explained by avoidance of pet keeping
39
by parents of atopic children, induced tolerance caused by the bigger allergic load in those
having pets, but also as a marker of difference in lifestyle. We did not find a similar association
in Tartu, furthermore, pet in infancy was a risk factor for mite associated symptoms of asthma.
All these findings together are in favour of the explanation that pet ownership can be  con-
founded by some other lifestyle aspects in some societies, while in other societies, like in Tartu,
it does not serve as a marker of way of life.
Half of the population both in Tartu and Uppsala live in buildings built after the 1960s. The age
of the home did not affect the concentration of house dust mites in one study where the asso-
ciation between the dwelling conditions and prevalence of house dust mites were analysed 212,
while higher humidity and poor ventilation have  been associated with high concentrations of
house dust mites 213,214. Energy saving measures during the last 20 years have changed the in-
door climate in Sweden. The higher prevalence of mite associated symptoms of respiratory al-
lergy in Uppsala among people living in older buildings may indicate that additional insulation
of older houses, rather than using modern tight constructions and new building materials, could
be responsible for mite associated respiratory symptoms. The energy crisis in the early 1970s
did not have a major impact on the building standards in the Soviet Union as energy continued
to be very cheap. Most of the houses built in Tartu after 1970 are standard 5-9-floor blocks of
flats that are centrally heated and do not have mechanical ventilation systems. In Tartu living in
houses built more recently tended to increase the risk of respiratory symptoms associated with
indoor allergens. Allergen levels are similar, however, in older and more recently built houses,
except for house dust mite, that was found in slightly higher concentrations in houses older than
25 years in Tartu 215.
Domestic gas use is the only indoor risk factor related to air quality that  with some consistency
has been found to be associated with BHR among adults 91-93. Home dampness is, however, a
recognised risk factor for respiratory symptoms in children 216-218. Visible mould can be consid-
ered an indirect marker of humidity and bad ventilation. The association of BHR and visible
mould indicates that indoor air quality has an impact on BHR in Tartu.
The low prevalence of atopy among the office workers in Tartu may appear surprising. The so-
cial structure in Estonia during the Soviet time did not resemble that of countries with market
economy, however, since manual workers were often more well off than people with a higher
education, i.e. university graduates. The observation does, therefore, not contradict suggestions
40
of an association between a high standard of living and an increased risk for atopic disease.
This was also the case in Uppsala where allergy to cat was particularly common among those
working as managers, legislative officials or administrators.
Allowing for measured exposures in multiple logistic regression analysis did not explain most
of the differences in the prevalence. After controlling for several risk factors, living in Tartu
was still associated with lower risk for atopy, symptoms of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis, but
with higher risk of nocturnal respiratory symptoms, wheezing and BHR. This indicates that
other, not measured risk factors play the major role. The climate, vegetation and pollen seasons
are similar in the two towns. As the levels of major indoor allergens are also similar in the two
regions 212,215, the differences in prevalence cannot be explained by differences in exposure to
allergens. No data on outdoor air pollution in Tartu are available from the beginning of the
1990s. As there is no major industry neither in Tartu nor in Uppsala, the main air pollution
comes from vehicles. The difference in gasoline used in Tartu and Uppsala at the beginning of
the 1990s may have resulted in differences in outdoor pollution between the two towns. The
differences in air pollution can hardly be responsible for the differences we found between
these two populations, however. Differences in lifestyle, that likely form the base of the differ-
ences in atopic sensitisation and allergies, are difficult to distract into measurable components.
It is likely that asthma prevalence has increased because of something that is lacking in the
modern environment, rather than through the positive reactions to some toxic factor. 
Man is exposed to the environment mainly via lungs and gut, the organs with the biggest total
surface area. The exposure is therefore mainly dependant on what we breathe and what we eat
and probably also, on whom we live with. In fact, there are more bacteria in man’s gut than
there are cells in the human organism. This assembly is in constant change and one of the im-
portant communication lines between micro organisms and mammals is the immune system of
the latter. Recent reports from studies in children indicate that roots in the increased prevalence
of atopy and asthma may lie in the changed microflora of the gut 200,201,219.
Methodological implications
The methodological implications of the study are, that dose-response curves should be validated
and transition equations calculated when different methods for measuring bronchial reactivity
to inhaled agents are compared. This is true even while using apparently similar well-
standardised dosimeter methods. If objective markers are used in asthma epidemiological stud-
ies, it is beneficial to encompass markers of cellular activity, like serum ECP, in addition to
41
physiological parameters, like BHR, to better describe the study subjects, especially when the
populations compared differ in risk factors for those markers. As far as asthma remains poorly
defined in epidemiological studies, postal questionnaires seem to be inexpensive and reliable
tools in estimating the prevalence of the disease. However, in addition to self reported asthma,
asthma related symptom complex rather than wheeze alone should be reported when studying
populations with differences in the prevalence of other respiratory diseases and awareness of
asthma.
Internal validity
The response rate in the questionnaire phase of the study was reasonably high in both centres,
but slightly lower in Tartu than in Uppsala. Women responded more often than men both in
Tartu and Uppsala. Current smoking was more common among the late responders than among
early responders. Twenty-five percent of the non-responders in Uppsala were randomly chosen
for a telephone interview 75. The prevalence of symptoms was similar among those who could
be reached and those who had answered the questionnaire. A similar analysis was not feasible
in Tartu, because of the low number of private telephones.
The proportion of symptomatic persons selected to the second phase of the study was higher in
Tartu than in Uppsala despite the lower prevalence of symptoms suggestive of asthma in the
mailed questionnaire. This depended on the selection criteria, which in addition to attacks of
asthma and current asthma medication comprised the symptom “woken by attack of  breath-
lessness”. The prevalence of this symptom was high in Tartu. The participation rate in the sec-
ond phase of the ECRHS was lower in Tartu than in Uppsala. In Tartu, persons with self re-
ported nasal allergies and symptoms suggestive of asthma appeared to be more willing to par-
ticipate in the second phase of the study. This selection bias would however tend to overesti-
mate the prevalence of allergy in Tartu, lowering the differences we have revealed between the
two centres. Participants in the clinical phase of the study who had respiratory symptoms
tended not to participate in BHR testing in Tartu, while the opposite was true in Uppsala. This
selection bias would not significantly alter our findings on the prevalence of BHR in the two
centres, as the prevalence of BHR was higher in Tartu. Despite our attempt to overcome the dif-
ferences in the methods used in BHR testing by using the transition equations, obtained in a
separate study (paper V), the possibility for a differential misclassification of BHR still re-
mains. The probable result of this misclassification would be that milder BHR has been labelled
in Tartu. This could dilute the effect but not affect our results in differences in risk factors.
42
External validity
As the study was conducted only in one centre in Estonia, a question can be raised on the exter-
nal validity of the results. Large differences between centres in one country were revealed in the
central analyses of the ECRHS data for respiratory symptoms as well as for BHR and atopic
sensitisation, indicating that estimations of prevalence rates of a whole country, based on meas-
urements of prevalence in one specific area should be interpreted with caution 220. Our results
have, however, in this respect been validated by a similar study in the age group 15-64 years,
conducted in three areas in Estonia: the capital of the country, Tallinn, an agricultural island in
the Baltic See, Saaremaa, and a heavily industrialised town located at the Russian border,
Narva. In concordance to ECRHS in Tartu, the prevalence of wheeze in the last 12 months was
high: among men 22,7% in Tallinn, 23,4% in Saaremaa and 26,4% in Narva and 19,7%, 19,3%
and 21,5% respectively among women. The prevalence of physician diagnosed asthma was
2.0% with minor differences between centres 221. 
Future aspects
As asthma prevalence in a population reflects both asthma incidence and the average duration
of the condition, it is important to know the persistence of symptoms, the incidence of new
cases and remissions and to study the factors that associate with incidence and remissions. Two
currently ongoing projects, ECRHS II and Respiratory Health in Northern Europe (RHINE),
that follow up different sub samples of  ECRHS, have been designed to find answers to these
questions.

CONCLUSIONS 
1. Symptoms of asthma and hay fever were less common in Estonia than in Sweden, while
respiratory symptoms in general were more common in Estonia. The differences in the
prevalence of symptoms that were likely to be caused by allergy, diminished with age, in-
dicating a probable cohort effect, the causes of which possibly date back to changes begin-
ning in the mid 1950s. The prevalence of nocturnal respiratory symptoms increased with
age in Tartu but not in Uppsala. Current smoking was a dominant risk factor for all respi-
ratory symptoms, except attacks of asthma, both in Tartu and Uppsala (I).
2. The prevalence of BHR was higher and the prevalence of atopic sensitisation lower among
young adults in Estonia, compared to Sweden. The biggest difference was in the prevalence
of cat and pollen atopy. There was some difference between risk factors for BHR and atopy
between Tartu and Uppsala, mostly of social and environmental origin. Theses differences,
however, could not explain the differences in prevalence for most outcome variables. The
low prevalence of hay fever and asthma in Tartu seemed to be partly explained by a lack of
awareness of  atopy and allergic diseases in the Estonian society (II-III).
3. In this Estonian population sample S-ECP was elevated in subjects with either BHR or at-
opy, but the levels were not related with asthma symptoms or lung function when other
asthma related variables were controlled for. Our results indicate that the level of eosino-
phil activation is low in a population with a low prevalence of atopy, even when bronchial
hyperresponsiveness is common (IV).
4. The estimated cumulative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 was smaller and the decline of
FEV1 /log(dose) curve steeper, using the Spira, compared to Mefar protocol. The dose re-
sponse of  lung function to inhaled agents, even while using apparently similar well stan-
dardised dosimeter methods, should be validated and transition equations calculated before
comparing the results (V).
